    description:
      "Replacement warehouse scanner app for Rowe Casa's DEACOM ERP — a native Kotlin/Compose client speaking DEACOM's XML protocol, recovered by decompiling the legacy client. 13 of 15 operator screens post live inventory transactions, each verified against the ERP test instance.",
    detailedDescription:
      "A ground-up replacement for the vendor's warehouse scanner app, running on the company's Honeywell CT47 fleet. Deacom is not being replaced — the legacy app is a thin XML client over a single HTTP endpoint, so this is a frontend rebuild against the same ERP installation.\n\nKey highlights:\n\n• Protocol client written from scratch. Command shapes were recovered by decompiling the legacy .NET client rather than from documentation, because the host reads fields positionally — a value in the wrong slot is silently misread rather than rejected, so a message can be well-formed, accepted, and wrong.\n\n• 13 of 15 operator screens are live, meaning driven end to end against Deacom Test and doing what their SOP says. The two that aren't are blocked on the host rather than on the app: one is refused until a job's work flow sequences are complete, and one is deliberately never pressed because a shipment cannot be reversed from a scanner.\n\n• A screen isn't done when it looks right — it's done when it has posted to Deacom Test and been read back from a separate session. Every posting claim is verified that way, and Test is left exactly as it was found.\n\n• 773 automated tests across four modules — 282 protocol, 74 scanning, 289 screens, 128 app — with the protocol layer kept free of Android dependencies so it can be driven by a fake transport with no device or host.\n\n• Cut the menu from Deacom's 26 entries to the 15 the company actually uses, by converting all 36 warehouse SOPs to text and searching them four ways: for WMS sections, for menu-option references, for headings, and for the concept behind each function rather than only its title. The evidence for every removal is written out beside the code.\n\n• Dual-host safety, because Production is live and no Deacom posting command carries an idempotency key — a mistake there is a real inventory transaction somebody has to find and reverse by hand. Test is the default host, the environment badge is permanent chrome that reads PRODUCTION in the error colour, and the Initialize version key is per release so a build pointed at the wrong installation is refused outright.\n\n• Barcode capture on two different hardware fleets behind one interface — Zebra TC52 through DataWedge broadcast intents, Honeywell through the vendor imager SDK, selected at build time by Gradle source set.\n\n• 102 findings tracked to closure in a running defect register that doubles as the progress tracker, on the reasoning that on this project the two are the same document.",
    dataIntegration:
      "Host: one Deacom HTTP endpoint per installation (Test and Production), spoken in Deacom's XML command protocol. Initialize handshake → sign-in with real Deacom credentials → per-command posts and reads.\n\nProtocol layer: the core-protocol module has no Android dependencies and is exercised through a fake transport, so command construction and reply parsing are tested with no device and no host. Command shapes and the literals the host pins were read off the decompiled legacy client.\n\nScanning: core-scanning abstracts the imager behind a common ScanHost interface. DataWedgeScanner handles Zebra's broadcast intents; HoneywellImager wraps the vendor SDK. Gradle picks the implementation by source set, so a build without the Honeywell SDK still compiles.\n\nTargets: Honeywell CT47 fleet on Android 13 (minSdk 26, targetSdk 33 — the version the device actually runs). Layouts are measured at 360dp wide, verified on both the CT47 emulator and a Zebra TC52 at 720×1280 @ 320dpi, which is the same 360dp.",

      "Multi-tenant AI coding platform for teams — browser-based Claude Code terminal, real-time file locks, activity feeds, and team rule syncing. Self-hosted on a VM behind a Cloudflare tunnel at orbitai.work.",
    detailedDescription:
      "A team-based AI coding platform built so entire IT teams can collaborate inside a shared Claude Code environment without installing anything locally. Teams sign up, invite members, create projects (git clone, zip upload, or blank), and work together with Claude AI through a browser.\n\nKey highlights:\n\n• Browser-based terminal — xterm.js in the browser connects over WebSocket to a broker on the VM, which spawns a per-user PTY running Claude Code. Each user gets their own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and OAuth token injected into the PTY env. No desktop install required.\n\n• Automatic file locking — when a user opens a project terminal, the broker starts an fs.watch on the project directory. Any file edit auto-locks the file for that user, broadcast via SSE so the entire team sees who's editing what in real-time. Locks release when all of a user's tabs disconnect.\n\n• Team + project rules synced to CLAUDE.md — rules are stored as JSON rule blocks in SQLite, then rules-sync.ts writes a combined CLAUDE.md into each project root so Claude Code picks them up automatically on startup.\n\n• Per-user AES-256-GCM encryption — Claude tokens and GitHub PATs are encrypted with keys derived via HMAC-SHA256(masterSecret, userId). Master key lives at ~/.config/orbit-ai/.mk with 0600 perms, scrubbed from PTY child environments so users with shell access can't extract it.\n\n• Real-time collaboration — SSE broadcast system pushes activity events (file edits, bash runs, session creates), lock changes, and presence updates to all connected clients. 30s heartbeat keeps the feed live.\n\n• Self-healing infrastructure — systemd user units (broker, tunnel, auto-deploy, watchdog) with `Restart=always`, `StartLimitIntervalSec=0`. Watchdog polls orbitai.work every 60s and restarts the tunnel or broker on failure. Cloudflare tunnel uses HTTP/2 over TCP/443 to survive QUIC/UDP drops through the VM's Hyper-V switch.\n\n• Auto-deploy from GitHub — auto-deploy.sh polls the repo every 60s, pulls on new commits, rebuilds the dashboard, and restarts the broker. Push to main = live in under a minute.\n\n• Optional Tauri v2 desktop app — CI builds native binaries on every tag push for users who prefer a native window over the browser.",

(2) API chat fallback — @anthropic-ai/sdk with prompt caching for users without a Claude subscription.\n\nReal-time: SSE streams for activity, file locks, session updates, and online-user presence. WebSocket for xterm.js ↔ PTY. PTY sessions survive browser disconnects — close a tab, reopen, reconnect to the same running process.\n\nTunnel: Cloudflare named tunnel `orbit-ai` (UUID 6ace143f-371e-474a-abbd-4238b5e5d961) → orbitai.work CNAME → localhost:5000.
